# Migrating from legacy HA (1+1) to Group mode (1+N)
This feature was introduced in 7.0 and support horizontal scalability of gateways in the spoke. In stead of having a primary and an HA gateway, you can now have up to <x> gateways in a spoke VPC/VNET.

## Impact
As the current ha gateway needs to be removed before the new additional gateways can be deployed, there may be impact on traffic flows. Execute this change in a maintenance window.

## Procedure
Moving from legacy HA to group mode is very simple. Follow the steps below:
- Set `manage_ha_gateway = false` on the module and apply the changes. This will take away control of the hagw from the aviatrix_spoke_gateway.
- Add `group_mode = true` to your mc-spoke module configuration. A new instance of the `aviatrix_spoke_ha_gateway` with the same properties will be created. Do no apply your changes, as we want to import the existing hagw against this instance.
- Import the existing hagw against the new `aviatrix_spoke_ha_gateway` Terraform resource using this command: `terraform import module.<module_name>.aviatrix_spoke_ha_gateway.hagw[0] <name of the hagw>`
- Once done, you can remove the `manage_ha_gateway` statement from the module, as the module will automatically enforce it when `group_mode` is enabled.

## Expanding
Once you have migrated from a legacy to group based HA, you can expand the amount of spoke gateways using the `spoke_gateway_amount` argument. This defaults to 2, creating 1+1 gateways. By increasing this number to the desired total number of gateways in the spoke, it will add instances of the `aviatrix_spoke_ha_gateway` resource.

## Limitations and caveats
- For backward compatibility (in order to be able to import), the second gateway will always be appended with -hagw. Any additional gateways will simple get a number (3 and up) to identify it.
- Any additional gateways deployed will be distributed over the same AZ's/zones as the first 2 gateways. This module currently does not support a 3 or more AZ distribution.
- When using insane_mode, /26 subnets for the gateways 3-n need to be supplied as an additional list using the `additional_group_mode_subnets` argument. Additional AZ's to create the additional group mode subnets in, can be set with `additional_group_mode_azs`.
- The `additional_group_mode_subnets` and `additional_group_mode_azs` arguments can also be used when using existing VPC's. Be aware that in normal operations, the controller assumes you have all subnets created already, while with insane mode the controller requires to create the subnets itself. As such, the `additional_group_mode_azs` only has to be set when using an existing VPC with insane mode, as in normal operations the pre created subnets are already deployed in a specific availability zone.
- Deploying additional gateways has to be done one by one. Increasing the `spoke_gateway_amount` by more than one will result in an error. Either increase one by one or apply multiple times.
